# hello-world
first github repository

I have been interested in computers my whole life. I did so programming as a kid on a TRS-80 commputer, went to vo-tech for electronics and computers in high school, and used to work in tech support. I am not sure why I did not continue with computers when I went to college. I am going to try out programming to see if I could do it as a career. I am pretty sure that I can.
